## Schedule for Spring 2018

### Week of April 3

* Tuesday  -- 

  * https://github.com/dask/dask-tutorial

  * Team work on contest

  * Midterm Analysis Requirements
    
    * Select a dataset that requires classification -- I'll set up a shared google spreadsheet for you to publish your selected dataset.  I'd like to keep duplication to a minimum.
    * Prepare a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates you have done exploratory data analysis on your selected data set.  Make sure you document at the top of the notebook what you are classifying.
    * Clean and prepare your dataset, documenting any additional variables you have computed, rescaling, removal of variables, etc.
    * Compare the results of the classification task using 3 different methods that we have discussed in class.  You should have a summary section where you do the comparison of - accuracy, confusion matrix, report, ROC curve and area under the ROC.  Make sure to explain any big differences between your different methods.
  
  * Due: By Thursday April 12.  We will use class time on the 12th and 17th for each of you to make a presentation of your work.

* Thursday - short team presentations on contest
  
  * By Tuesday April 10 Can you reproduce your results on the full data set??

### Week of March 13

* Look at the Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers and/or dive into the kaggle contest.

* Tuesday

  - Take a look at [This Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection?utm_medium=email&utm_source=intercom&utm_campaign=talkingdata+competition+2018)  Shall we give it a try?

### Week of March 6

* Tuesday 

  - Logistic Regression
  - Gradient Descent

* Thursday

  - Finish up Gradient Descent

    - Run our linear regression algorithm on the mushroom data -- We'll need to tweak our class just a bit to adjust sizes based on the data we give it.
    - Tweak our learning to adjust the learning rate as we iterate
    - Convert our algorithm to learn using the logistic function *and be amazed*
    - Make a version that can use the logistic regression algorithm to classify multiple classes


### Week of Feb 27

* Tuesday 

  - Regression with the mushroom data.

* Wednesday -- iriskm assignment due at 5:00


* Thursday -- Guest speaker on Support Vector Machines


### Week of Feb 20

* Tuesday

  - finish up the curse of dimensionality
  - what is principle components analysis
  - doing PCA on our mushroom data
  - doing PCA with iris data

* Wednesday -- First Iris Assignment due at 5:00

* Thursday
  
  - Kmeans clustering
  - Kmeans on our reduced PCA data
  - scoring kmeans


### Week of Feb 13

* For Tuesday you should have asked and answered two questions about the mushroom data set.  Be prepeared to share those questions and answers in class
* Tuesday: - The Curse of dimensionality


* Thursday: - Principle Components Analysis

### Week of Feb 8

* Mushrooms! - Should you eat this one or not?

* Getting data
* Cleaning and plotting data
* Starting to use scikit-learn

**Resources**

* Machine Learning Overview with scikit-learn
* First half of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7R4HUQ-eQ0

* [ipython Notebook cheatsheet](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pybokeh/ipython_notebooks/blob/master/pandas/PandasCheatSheet.ipynb#options)
